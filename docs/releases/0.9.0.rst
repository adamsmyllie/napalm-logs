.. _release-0.9.0:

=================================
Release 0.9.0 - Codename Hand Saw
=================================

New Publisher Interface: Alerta
-------------------------------

Publish napalm-logs events to an `Alerta <https://alerta.io/>`__ endpoint.
The messages are published as alerts in the form ``<host>::<message ID>``, 
e.g., ``router1::NTP_SERVER_UNREACHABLE``. See the following screenshot for
a visual example:

    :alt: Alerta Screenshot

The alert is sent together with the complete napalm-logs event data, under the
``attributes`` Alerta field, which you can potentially use for leveraging 
various automatic actions or processing from these alerts. Using Alerta is 
a great option to handle duplicate alerts.

See :ref:`publisher-alerta` for more details.

Update the key name for Fortinet
--------------------------------

The field ``source_ip``, and ``destination_ip`` have been renamed to 
``source_address`` and ``destination_address`` respectively. See `PR #313 
<https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm-logs/pull/313>`_ for more 
information.

Fix Prometheus label displaying
-------------------------------

Avoid to display the 'b' prefix on the label with Python3. Thanks @Koaxiel 
(Robin Douine) for `PR #317 
<https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm-logs/pull/317>`_.


New Structured Messages
-----------------------

:ref:`NH_REGION_GRAB_FAILED` for Junos, a message from the FPC logs when failed
to grab new region for next-hops. Thanks @luke-orden `PR #314 
<https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm-logs/pull/314>`_.
